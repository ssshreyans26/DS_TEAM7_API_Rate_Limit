# TEAM_4

To Execute:
	1) Download and run redis-server:
			Linux: 		https://redis.io/download
			Windows:	https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads
	2) Run 'npm install', to download all the required dependencies
	3) Run 'npm start'
	4) Navigate to http://localhost:3000 on the browser of your choice

NOTE:
	Steps 1 & 2 need to be only performed during first run, for consequent run only steps 2 & 3 maybe be performed.
	Redis Server is required for this application to work. We have tested using v5.05, however any version should work for the most part.
